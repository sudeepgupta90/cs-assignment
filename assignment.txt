Assignment Overview
Design and implement a scalable machine learning model lifecycle management
solution that demonstrates your MLOps expertise and architectural thinking.
Timeline- Duration**: 2-3 days
Core Requirements
Functional Requirements
1. Model Training**: Automated training pipeline with experiment tracking
2. Model Deployment**: Multi-environment deployment with serving capabilities
3. Model Monitoring**: Performance monitoring and drift detection
4. Model Management**: Versioning, registry, and governance workflows
Technical Requirements
1. Scalability**: Support multiple models and concurrent users
2. Reliability**: Production-ready with appropriate error handling
3. Observability**: Monitoring, logging, and alerting capabilities
4. Security**: Authentication and access controls
Constraints
1. Must be containerized and cloud-deployable
2. Include both real-time and batch inference options
3. Provide a user interface or API for interaction
4. Support at least one popular ML framework
Bonus
Design a workflow orchestrator (using Airflow/Kubeflow). Integrate MLflow with
workflow orchestration, effectively mimicking model training/retraining automation
in a production environment
